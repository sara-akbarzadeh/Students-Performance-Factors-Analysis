# Student Performance Factors Analysis  

This project analyzes the **Student Performance Factors** dataset from Kaggle to identify key influences on academic success. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and statistical methods such as **t-tests, ANOVA, and correlation analyses**, we examine factors like **study habits, sleep duration, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, internet access, and socio-economic status**. The insights gained provide valuable guidance for educators and policymakers to enhance student performance through data-driven strategies.
